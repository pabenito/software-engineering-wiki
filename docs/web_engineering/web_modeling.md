# Web modeling

## What is a web model?

See _model_ definition in [glossary](glossary.md#definitions).  

A web model allows you to specify web sites from web development components; i.e. [_IFML_](https://www.ifml.org).

### Web characteristics

Web models take into account:

- Static and dynamic aspects of content
- hypertext and navigation
- Presentation levels

### Web dimensions

- **Content**: Information handled by the application.
- **Presentation**: Visual layout of the elements and their relationships.
- **Prototyping**: Validation with users and testing. 

## Why use web models?

Models are super-powerful development tools.

 

### Eases the development

- Reduces complexity
- Documents design decisions
- Is a means of communication

### Web models usages

The use of models is increasing in software development.

Web model as a **draft**: 

- Communicates ideas
- **Highlights** what is most important
- People-oriented
- **Informal** and **incomplete**

Web model as a **guide**:

- **Documents** design decisions
- **Solution**-oriented
- **Rigorous** and **consistent**

Web model as a **program**: Model driven development (**_MDD_**)

- **Isolates** the **specification** of the system from its functionality and the technology used in **implementation**
- Distinguishes between platform-independent model (_PIM_) and platform-specific model (_PSM_)
- The model is **converted into code**
- **Automatic generation** of applications
- Transformations are the key element

### _MDD_ for web

_MDD_ is increasingly used because of its great potential.

#### Advantages

- Better than traditional _ad-hoc_ development.
- It is a solid starting point for implementation
- Avoids problems such as:
    - Insufficient fulfillment of requirements
    - Wrong specifications
    - Lack of system documentation

## Tools 

Tools is what developers need. There are some web model tools: 

[IFMLEdit](http://editor.ifmledit.org):

- Based on [_IFML_](http://www.ifml.org) standard. 
- _PIM_
- Simple
- Online runable Prototype
- Generate implementation

[WebRation](http://www.webratio.com)

- Web Platform (requires Java 7)
- OMG Specification
- Courses

[Figma](https://www.figma.com):

- For _UI_ design
- _PSM_ 
- Online runable Prototype
