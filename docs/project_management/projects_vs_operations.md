# Projects vs operations

Questions about projects and operations:

- What is a **_project_**? 
- What is an **_operation_**? 
- What is the **difference** between them?
- How to **manage** them?

## Project

A project is a **temporary** endeavor undertaken by a company or _organization_ to achieve an **_project objective_** with an established **budget**. 

### Temporary

A project must have a **start** and **end** date, **BOTH!**.

The project **ends** when:

- The objective has been **achieved**.
- when it is clear that the objectives will not or **cannot be achieved**. 
- when the **need** for the project **no longer exists**.

### Objective

The _project objective_ is what the _organization_ aims to achieve with this _project. **_Deliverables_** are planned to achieve these _project objectives_. 

Note that the _project objective_ is not to produce _deliverables_, but rather that _deliverables_ are a means to achieve _project objectives_. 

**_Deliverables_** are clasified as products, sercives or results:

- **Product**: An element, physical or not-physical.
- **Service**: Any type of service. 
- **Result**: knowledge. 

There are some examples:

- **Software development**: 
    - An application. (Product)
    - Its user manual. (Product)
    - A training session conducted on the application. (Service)
- **Software maintenance**: 
    - A service for handling requests for changes and error detection. (Service)
    - Monthly reports. (Result)
- **Server administration**: 
    - Logging of operations performed, backups, installations, queries, etc. (Results)
    - Recovery plans. (Result)
    - Increased memory or computation capacity. (Product)
- **Give a course**:
    - Course given. (Service)
    - Developed material. (Result)
- **Design a sales campaign**:
    - Campaign documentation. (Result)
    - Promotional brochures. (Product)
- **Write an article**:
    - The article with the results. (Product)
    - Documentation on the tests performed. (Result)

### Misconceptions

_Organizations_ call many different things a _project_:

- Smaller, unbounded activities.
- Activities that are more global, not bounded, and permanent in time.
- Companies as projects.
- Programs, actions and initiatives as projects.

A _project_ must be clear and temporally bounded.

### Metodology

It is important to establish a **standard methodology**, which can be slightly **adjusted for each project** depending on its **characteristics** and **size**.

## _Operations_

_Operations_ are **ongoing** **routine tasks** that follow a company's procedures. 

**Characteristics**:

- **Don't** produce new **deliverables**. 
- Are **less risky**. 
- Are **permanent**.
- Provides the **same result or service** to maintain the **day-to-day** business. 

## Differences

_Organizations_ execute their work in order to achieve their objectives. This work can be categorized:

- As work to be performed in a _project_.
- As part of the _operations_ defined in the _organization_. 

So _projects_ and _operations_ are usually confused. 

**Similarities**:

- Planned, executed, and monitored.
- Executed by people.
- Limited resources.

**Differences**: 

| Characteristic | _Projects_ | _Operations_ |
|----------------|------------|--------------|
| Purpose | Achieve the defined objectives and finish | Sustaini the _organization_ |
| Temporality | Temporary. Defined start and end | Performed continuously |
| People | Temporary and dynamic teams to meet the needs of the project | Functional teams aligned with the _organization_ |
| Authority over the manager | The project manager has the ultimate authority, if there is someone above him, he is connected to him | There is an hierarchy established between the manager and a higher authority |
