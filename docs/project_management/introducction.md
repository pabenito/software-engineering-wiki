## Orgatization

_Organizations_ are guided by theirs _vision_ and _mission_, so they must manage their _resources_ efficiently to fulfil them. This gap (the "manage") between _vision_ and _mission_ and _resources_ is where project management comes in.

As the figure shows, an entire organizatinal strategy is planned. Then this strategy leads to the management of _portfolios_, _programs_ and _projects_.

### Attitude towards change

The organizatinal strategy and project planning seems to be static---planned for a whole year, and then it is nerver touched again---but is not. The world is constantly changing and organizations that want to survive must do so as well.

### Project management methodologies

For project management it is necessary to define an appropriate methodology. There are some of them:

- [SCRUM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) (software development) 
- [PMBOK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Management_Body_of_Knowledge)
- [KANBAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) 

## _Portfolios_, _programs_ and _projects_

See [glossary](#definitions).

The idea is to group the _resources_ of related _projects_, so that _resources_ are better utilized and easier to organize.

As the figure shows there is a hierarchy: _Portfolios_ > _Programs_ > _Project_.

- **Market Demand**: An automobile manufacturing company authorizes a project that will build more efficient cars.
